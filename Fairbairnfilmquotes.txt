For every man that builds a house another house has no man
Fool me once shame on you; but teach a man to fool me and I'll be fooled the rest of my life
They say a man who lays a brick will reap what he sows, but a man who reaps a crop that he sowed will have limited bricklaying ability.
A sparrow never builds the same nest two times
3 men never sailed 2 boats with one sail
Never look a blind donkey in its left eye
Never trust a man who never uses his back pockets
You never know where you won't go, if you never don't go there
For every truck that passes you by, three cross a bridge
For every 3 dollars you save, put double away so you can halve it and put both halves into a savings account
Always put your horse in the stables before the breeze blows the hay out of the barn 
Always choose a hat you don't think you won't need
You never know where you won't go, if you never don't go there
